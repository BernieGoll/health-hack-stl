# Description

PillCheck provides a simple solution to improve patient medication adherence. PillCheck sends telephone reminder calls to verify that prescribed medication was taken for that day and alerts family members if their loved ones have not responded or missed their medication. All that your loved one needs is a telephone number- no smart phones or complicated apps!

# Problem Statement

* Adherence to medication regimen is poor for aging population
* No one has addressed this in an effective manner. Over 100 apps exist to date, and the problem persists…
* “A (2012) review in the Annals of Internal Medicine estimates that a lack of adherence causes nearly 125,000 deaths, 10 percent of hospitalizations and costs the already strained healthcare system between $100–$289 billion a year.” -https://www.nacds.org/news/the-cost-of-medication-non-adherence/

# Relevant Statistics

* Internet: 41% of >65 year olds do not use the internet at all, 53% do not have broadband access at home. 53% of 75-79 year olds do not use the internet at all, 64% do not have broadband access at home
* Cell Phone: 23% of >65 year olds do not use cell phones and only 18% of seniors are smartphone adopters. Only 10% of 75-79 year olds own a smartphone, and just 5% of those 80 and older are smartphone owners.
* Older, lower-income, and less highly educated seniors use the internet and broadband at rates lower than their senior counterparts.
* Telephone interviews with a nationally representative sample of 6,224 people ages 16 and older living in the United States. Interviews were conducted via landline (nLL=3,122) and cell phone (nC=3,102, including 1,588 without a landline phone). 
* Results based on the 5,320 internet users have a margin of sampling error of ±1.5 percentage points.
* Poor adherence causes approximately 33% to 69% of medication-related hospitalizations.4
* Irrespective of disease, medication complexity, or how adherence is measured, the average adherence rate to chronic medication therapy is approximately 50%.5
* Medication nonadherence is widespread and varied by disease, patient characteristics, and insurance coverage, with nonadherence rates ranging from 25% to 50%.6,27 
* In the US, nearly half of all adults have at least one chronic disease28 and the percentage of Americans taking at least one prescription drug increased from 38% in the period 1988–1994 to 49% in the period 2007–2010; during the same time the number of adults taking three or more prescription drugs doubled.26 
* Prescription medication use will increase as the population ages.
